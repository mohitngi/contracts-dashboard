## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** - Modern functional components with hooks
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling (no Bootstrap or inline CSS)
- **React Router** - Client-side routing and navigation

### State Management
- **React Context API** - Global state management
- Separate contexts for authentication and application state
- Persistent localStorage integration

### Development Tools
- **Vite** - Fast development server and build tool
- **ESLint** - Code linting and quality enforcement
- **PostCSS** - CSS processing with Tailwind

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm (or yarn/pnpm)
- Modern web browser

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/contractai-dashboard.git
   cd contractai-dashboard
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview  # Preview the build locally
```

## üîë Demo Credentials

- **Username**: Any username (e.g., "admin", "john", "demo")
- **Password**: `test123`

## üé® Design Decisions

### UI/UX Approach
- **Clean, Modern Design**: Professional dashboard aesthetic suitable for enterprise users
- **Responsive First**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints for tablet and desktop
- **Color System**: Consistent color palette with semantic meaning (red for high risk, green for active, amber for warnings)
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy with readable font sizes and proper spacing
- **Micro-interactions**: Smooth hover states and transitions for enhanced user experience

### Technical Choices

#### State Management - React Context API
- **Why Context over Redux**: For this scope, Context API provides sufficient state management without the boilerplate of Redux
- **Separation of Concerns**: Separate contexts for auth and app state to avoid unnecessary re-renders
- **Local Storage Integration**: Seamless persistence of authentication state

#### Styling - Tailwind CSS
- **Utility-First Approach**: Rapid development with consistent design system
- **Responsive Design**: Built-in responsive utilities for all screen sizes
- **Component Composition**: Easy to maintain and scale styling patterns

#### Routing - React Router
- **Client-Side Navigation**: Smooth SPA experience without page refreshes
- **Protected Routes**: Authentication-based route access control
- **URL-Based State**: Shareable URLs for contract details and navigation state

### Mock Data Strategy
- **Local JSON Files**: Simulating real API responses with realistic contract data
- **Error Simulation**: Built-in error states and loading simulations
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Easy to replace with real API calls

## üîß API Integration

The application uses mock JSON files to simulate API responses:

- **Contracts List**: `/public/contracts.json`
- **Contract Details**: `/public/contract-details.json`

### API Endpoints (Simulated)
```typescript
GET /contracts          // List all contracts with basic info
GET /contracts/:id      // Detailed contract analysis
POST /upload           // File upload (mocked)
POST /auth/login       // Authentication (mocked)
```

## üì± Responsive Design

- **Mobile** (< 768px): Collapsible sidebar, optimized touch targets
- **Tablet** (768px - 1024px): Balanced layout with accessible navigation
- **Desktop** (> 1024px): Full sidebar navigation with optimal content width

## üöÄ Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)
1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Connect repository to Vercel
3. Deploy automatically on every push

### Netlify Alternative
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Drag and drop the `dist` folder to Netlify
3. Configure redirects for SPA routing

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- Real backend API integration
- Advanced contract analytics and reporting
- Document preview functionality
- Team collaboration features
- Advanced search with AI-powered querying
- Contract comparison tools
- Automated renewal notifications
- Integration with document management systems

## üß™ Testing Strategy

- Component unit testing with React Testing Library
- Integration testing for user workflows
- E2E testing with Playwright or Cypress
- Performance testing and optimization

## üìù Assumptions Made

1. **Mock Authentication**: Real authentication would integrate with enterprise SSO
2. **File Upload**: Actual implementation would require backend file processing
3. **AI Analysis**: Contract analysis would be powered by real NLP/ML services
4. **Data Persistence**: Production app would use database for contract storage
5. **User Management**: Multi-tenant architecture with role-based access control
6. **Contract Parsing**: Real document parsing would extract structured data from PDFs
